<h1>Welcome to Project Indigo!</h1>

Project Indigo is an open source project designed to replace the long prevelant "mod-pack" methodology in the Minecraft
modding community.
Instead of having a select few packs available and server owners having to make due with the mods and configuration 
forced upon them by the pack, server owners decide the mods and configs for their own server. Project
Indigo will automatically keep the clients up to date with the server mods.

Bugs can be fixed and mods can be changed all on the fly, without having to worry about client-server comatibility.

This offers server owners a whole new level of flexibility in the features, style and gameplay they want for
their server.

<h3>Sounds great! How can I help!?</h3>

Again, this is an open source project. If you find a bug you can either report it to us, or even fork it, fix it,
and create a pull request.

<h4>Happy modding!<h4>
