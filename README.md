<h2>What is Project Indigo?</h2>
Wouldn't it be nice if there was one Launcher that could hook into your server and provide only the modpacks you have available. Well that's what Project Indigo does!

We currently hook directly into <a href="http://feed-the-beast.com">Feed-The-Beast</a>, <a href="http://atlauncher.com">AtLauncher</a> and the <a href="http://technicpack.net">Technic Launcher</a> and will automatically fetch modpacks directly from their sources so you don't have to host any files yourself. We also include the same information that these launchers include for these modpacks (Descriptions, Mod Listings). All you need to do is provide the launcher with a URL that contains basic information about your server and we take care of the rest. It also handles updates based off of your server rather than the modpack!

For the moment if this launcher is unique to <a href="http://www.forsaken.co">The Forsaken Network</a>, however if you would like to have this available to your server as well, please contact our <a href="http://www.twitter.com/itsryanvanZeben">main developer</a> and we will see what we can do for you.
